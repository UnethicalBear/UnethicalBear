- ### Hi, I’m @UnethicalBear
- I’m interested in C++, Python, Microcontrollers and Unity.
- I’m currently looking to make my own linux based operating system.
- I have a mixture of private and public repos - the public ones only scratch the surface.
- When I'm ready to release closed-source software, I'll make a new repo for the releases.
